## Discussing

The easiest way to contribute to Salad is by participating in discussions on our [SaladChefs Discord server](https://discord.gg/TsZrHWV). The community often chimes in with helpful advice when you have a question, and you may also find yourself providing answers and helping others.

You can also create a [support ticket](https://support.salad.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you have a specific question that should be answered by a team member.

_Please don't use GitHub issues to ask a question._ We will politely close a GitHub issue that asks a question and kindly refer you to one of the aforementioned avenues.

## Reporting Bugs

We're sorry if this happened to you!

Consider jumping into the [#official-support or #community-support channel in the SaladChefs Discord server](https://discord.gg/TsZrHWV). The community may have already found a solution.

You can also create a [support ticket](https://salad.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to report any problems or concerns.

GitHub issues may be used to report technical bugs; however, we will be unable discuss any account-specific problems on GitHub issues due to privacy concerns.

## Requesting Features

We love a good idea. Do you have one?

Consider jumping into the [#feature-requests channel on the SaladChefs Discord server](https://discord.gg/TsZrHWV). The community may have some interesting insights.

## Changing Code

Interested in changing the world?

First, identify the scale of your proposed changes. If it is a small change, such as to fix grammar or spelling, feel free to start working on a fix. However, if it is a feature or substantial code contribution, please discuss it with the team first to ensure it fits in the product roadmap.

You can propose code changes by submitting GitHub pull requests. The code changes are expected to fit existing code styles and conventions. Using Visual Studio Code with the recommended extensions should minimize any manual work associated with code styles (see [Setting Up a Development Environment](#setting-up-a-development-dnvironment)).

Additionally, please consider taking a moment to read Miguel de Icaza's blog post titled [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](https://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) and Ilya Grigorik's blog post titled [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/).

### Setting Up a Development Environment

First, you're going to need a few development tools:

- [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (if you're on Linux or macOS) or [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) (if you're on Windows)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Yarn version 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (version 2 doesn't work with Salad just yet)

We try to stay on the latest, stable versions of these tools, and we recommend that you choose to do the same. We will be unable to provide technical support for these tools, and old versions may not work with our project configuration.

Next, launch Visual Studio Code and install the following essential extensions:

- [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

Refer to the [Visual Studio Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) for help finding and installing these extensions.

Next, use nvm (if you're on Linux or macOS) or NVM for Windows (if you're on Windows) to install the required version of Node.js.

In a Bash terminal on Linux or macOS:

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
```

In a Command Prompt terminal on Windows:

```cmd
set /p node_version= < .nvmrc
nvm install %node_version%
nvm use %node_version%
```

In a PowerShell terminal on Windows:

```ps
$NodeVersion = Get-Content .nvmrc
& nvm install $NodeVersion
& nvm use $NodeVersion
```

### Setting Up the Project

First, you're going to need to clone the repository.

In your favorite terminal, change the current working directory to a location suitable for storing the repository. Then run the following:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/salad-applications.git
```

Next, restore the project dependencies and tooling.

In your favorite terminal, change the current working directory to the location of the cloned repository. Then run the following:

```sh
yarn install
```

Finally, open the location of the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code. Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette. Choose the "Select TypeScript Version" command, and choose the "Use Workspace Version" option.
