# Adding Platform Icons

All platform icons added to the project need to match the measurements of `128x128` in PNG format. You must also utilize an image optimizer tool to reduce the file size as much as possible. If you are having trouble finding/modifying a platform icon that fits these requirements, reach out to the design team for help.
